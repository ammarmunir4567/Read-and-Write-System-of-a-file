# Read-and-Write-System-of-a-file
During Covid, most of the businesses went online. The employees need to access the official documents at home to work. An international company ZROX moved online and created an online repository of important files on its server. Authorized employees can access the files from the different branches. The employees can read and write the files. The different employees (users) can simultaneously access the same file, which can pose a problem in some scenarios. Let say user A and user B try to access File X from their computer systems. • If both A and B want to read File X, then there is no problem • If both A and B want to update(write), File X. This can create a problem, and the system would be confused about which value to retain. • If A wants to write on File X and B wants to read File X. This is also problematic. As A is updating file X, and B tries to read X, user B can read invalid values. The easiest and simple solution is to allow different users to read a file simultaneously, but we do not allow them to update a file simultaneously. If one user wants to write\update an existing file, then other users must wait till he is done. Note, if a user wants both read and write access to a file. Then he would just ask for write access as he can read while writing.
